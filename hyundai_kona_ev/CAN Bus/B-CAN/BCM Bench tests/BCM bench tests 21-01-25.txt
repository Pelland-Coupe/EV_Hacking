Bench testing BCM.

CAN 0 is P-CAN and CAN 1 is B-CAN

RLY 3 - IG1 - F2 - ON/Start - M02-A pin 2
RLY 8 - ACC - F37 - ACC/ON - M02-A pin 12
RLY 6 - IG2 - F19 - ON - M02-A pin 3

# test 1 - connect power to Memory Power only - M02-A Pin 1

Produces a burst of messages on P-CAN and B-CAN then stops 
Current drops from 63mA to 3mA

# Test 2 Add ACC power - Normally Supplied by Relay 8 
Messages restart and then continue 
Current raises to 64mA

Only the following change value once started.
0x100
0x400

Run UDS "Tester Present" scan 0x700 to 0x7FF agains P-CAN - No response
Run UDS "Tester Present" scan 0x700 to 0x7FF agains B-CAN - No response

# Test 3 remove ACC power 

Messages continue for some time then stop.

# Test 4 Try individual power added to ACC power

Pin 2 ON/ Start power 
Current 75mA.
Lots of constant messages 
Remove power and messages remain but current drops to 63mA


 Power down Memory. Wait - repower memory and wait for messages to stop.

Pin 3 - "ON" power
Current 69mA
Lots of messages, changes to start but then settled to constant
Remove power and messages continute then stop.

 
# Test 5 try Added power in following order
Pin 12, Pin 2, Pin 3.

Frame 1 - add Pin 12. disconnect frame  6940

Frame 650  - add pin 2 disconnect frame  6250

Frame 1600   - add pin 3 disconnect frame 5680


Saved as "BCM add sequence then remove power.csv"

# Test 6 all power on then trigger inputs
