Investigating the BCM CAN messages on P-CAN and B-CAN.

## P-CAN produces a single message when disconnected from the P-CAN
0x593

length 6 bytes
starts all 0x00 for 14 mesages. 
Appears to run approx 1 per second. Time stamp missing for some reason.

At message 15 changes to 0x01 0x00, 0xff , 0xff 0xff, 0xff

No response to any UDS scans from 0x700 to 0x7FF.


### B-CAN

First capture at power on, approx 50 frames/S

10 different IDs.

No response to UDS scans.

0x100
0x101
0x102
0x103
0x104
0x105
0x106
0x107 - in DBC as <UNK_B107>
0x109 - in DBC as <VCU_109>. Is this originated from 2 modules?
0x400


Next step is to place on bench and excersize inputs.
