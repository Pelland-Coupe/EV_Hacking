This is what I have discovered about the airbag module by powering it up on the bench.

The module is from my 2021 Kona that had a major front impact.
Both front airbags had deployed and most seatbelts also seem to have triggered.

I got no response from the P-CAN interface when the module was in my test setup so I powered it up stand alone.
P-CAN & C-CAN both Respond.

Airbag controller - 19-01-25.txt contains my observations.

The Logs folder carries the CAN logs and the Savvycan scan results. Hopefully names are self explanitry.
