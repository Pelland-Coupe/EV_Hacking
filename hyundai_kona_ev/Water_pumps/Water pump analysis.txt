Byte 0 - steps from 0x00 to 0x02 at frame 61 (bit 1)
Byte 1 - Increases with pump speed
Byte 2 - Always 0x85
Byte 3 - always 0x00
Byte 4 - Increases with pump speed
Byte 5 - counts up to 9 and back down 1 at the start of each rise in speed. Not all valuse seen in count. Stays at 1 for most, not all, of the run.
Byte 6 - Always 0x00
Byte 7 - steps from 0x00 to 0x10 at frame 61 (bit 60)


First change at frame 22

Locked rotor:
Byte 0 - always 0
Byte 1 - Increases with attempt to run
Byte 2 - Always 0x85
Byte 3 - always 0x00
Byte 4 - Increases with attempt to turn
Byte 5 - counts up to 9 and back down 1 at the start of each start attempt. Not all valuse seen in count. Stays at 1 for most, not all, of the run.

0x4DE  has step in Byte 0 at close to the same time. - correlates perfectly on start, stop is slight lag of about 3 messages. steps from 0x00 to 0x0A (bit 1 & 3 set)
0x59E  has a dip in byte 4 at close to the same time
0x5D8  has a dip in byte 6 at close to the same time


sending the idle frame for 0x4DE keeps pump off. Sending 0x0A in byte 0 causes the pump to cycle but at low speed.

**Playing back a limited block of a capture which has rear pump idle
-While frame 0x4DE is sent pump sits idle and just outputs Byte 2 - 0x85
-disabling 0x4DE pump starts cycling (Not loaded) and 
		--bit 1 is set
		-- between cycles bit 60 is set, but clears part way into next cycle

** tests just sending 0x4DE with empty payload turning on single bits.
Listems to 0x4DE (100mS signal) 
Sets Byte(0).1=1 (bit 1) when not hearing 0x4DE.
0x4DE - Any bit on byte 0 starts pump - may run faster with higher bit numbers. Need to put under load and retest.

		*************** Start of comprehensive tests to match front pump ***

# 4:14 pm 30/11/2024 rear pump - dry with Command Frame 0x4DE all 0x00

Change set command to 0x40 in Byte(0) 
Pump cycles the same as the front pump and sets bit 1 & 60.

# 4:20 pm 30/11/2024   rear pump - dry with Command Frame 0x4DE all bytes(0) 0x00 Bytes 1 to 7 all 0xFF

Pump remains idle.

# 4:24 pm 30/11/2024   rear pump - dry with two Command Frames 
0x4DE all bytes(0) 0x00 Bytes 1 to 7 all 0xFF
0x523 all 0x00

Setting bit 60 in frame 0x523 will start pump purging cycle.

# 4:27 pm 30/11/2024 rear pump - dry with two Command Frames 
0x4DE all bytes(0) 0x00 Bytes 1 to 7 all 0xFF
0x523 all 0x00

Stop sending 0x4DE

Pump remains quiet. Appears that either command being receieved will keep pump happy.

# 4:31 pm 30/11/2024  rear pump - dry with two Command Frames 
0x4DE all bytes(0) 0x00 Bytes 1 to 7 all 0xFF
0x523 all bits except bit 60 set. Bit 60=0

No reaction to any other bit in 0x523


# 4:36 pm 30/11/2024 rear pump with water, Flow valve wide open, No command frame sent.

Pump ramps to max speed & flow


# 4:41 pm 30/11/2024 rear pump with water, Flow valve wide open,Command Frame 0x4DE all bytes(0) 0x00 Bytes 1 to 7 all 0xFF

step up bits in byte 1

Pump behaves just like the front one

Listems to 0x523 (10mS signal) - is happy if sent at only 100mS
Sets Byte(0).1=1 (bit 1) when not hearing 0x523. (2:09 pm 30/11/2024 this turns out to be caused by currect limit on PSU)

0x523 - Any bit on byte 6 starts pump - may run faster with higher bit numbers. Need to put under load and retest.
0x523 - Byte 7 bit 4 (bit 60) makes pump screem. (is this the "bleed" signal?)


***************************************
Front-pump 2024-11-29 1716.

Flow restricter set so pump won't cycle with no CAN input - runs continuosly 
start fussing with empty 0x523.
Turn power on.

Run through turning bits on only one at a time.

When Byte(7).4 is set turned flow restrictor fully open and then back to previous.

Stopped fussing and left pump running.
played with flow restrictor.

turned power off.

** none of the 3 alarm bits show at any point. even with fussing stop and flow unrestricted so pump cycles.

reduced voltage to 7.9 volts - Bit 1 & Bit 58 set.
Increased voltage to 9 volts - Bit 1 & Bit 58 clear.
 Both Bits set and clear together in same frame. 

11:02 am 30/11/2024 turn power off.


Test to see what effect changing load has on data.

#12:58 pm 30/11/2024  savvycan started

Pump rang, stopped and then ran continously
When pump stopped, bit 1 & 57 set


Running Current about 5.6A

#1:10 pm 30/11/2024 savvycan started

pump cycling and producing bit 1 & 57 alarms
Alarm appears to be at about 5.8A.


# 3:06 pm 30/11/2024 savvycan started
power applied, flow control wide open. running through bit values on byte 6.

As soon as a bit is set in byte 6 pump speed (byte(1)) goes to 0x2D, min speed
Once commanded speed reaches 0x2D commanded and set track until current reaches just below alarm threshold. The set speed remains constant while commanded increases.

Current reading Byte(5) exactly tracks current * 10. 

# 3:18 pm 30/11/2024 savvycan started
power applied, flow control wide open. byte 6 set to 0xFF.

Flow control slowly reduced to see if speed will increase to hold current constant.
 set speed increased, but not all the way to commanded speed.

Once flow dropped below a certain level, and current, the pump stopped. No alarms showing though.


# 3:25 pm 30/11/2024 another run the same 
 0xA6 appears to be max set point even at lower currents.


# 3:34 pm 30/11/2024 savvycan started
power applied, flow control wide open. turn bit 60 on & off

Bit 60 off. turn flow off
 bit 60 back on


**** Tests without water

# 3:40 pm 30/11/2024 power applied to dry pump. No command frame.

Both bits 56 & 60 get set 

# 3:46 pm 30/11/2024 power applied to dry pump. With Command frame.
 
Turn on purge bit.

Pump does initial current spike 0x8E (14.2A)

The settles into cycle on/off Byte(0) around 0xC7
Sets bit 56 at the end of each run cycle

# 3:54 pm 30/11/2024 power applied to dry pump. With Command frame.
 
Apply minimum command

clear command

apply higher command - note accidentally turned on purge during this step.

Result is same for both commands
Bit 60 gets set during the cycling.


Finish with front pump.
