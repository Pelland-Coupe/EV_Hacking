These are the various log files I captured while excersizing the waterpumps on the bench totaly disconnected from the car.

See Water_Pump_analysis.txt in the Water_pumps directory for some indication of what each log is about.

Lines starting with "#" contain the timestamp used for that run. Other timestamps are estimates when the activity was done - not very accurate though
