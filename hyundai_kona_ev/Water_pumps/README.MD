Information discovered about the two electric water pumps used on the Kona.

There is a front and a rear pump. 
They are very similar but use different CAN IDs to send and receive information.

Water pump analysis.txt contains information about what was being done when each log was captured, and some observation of the results.
Water pump tests.xls is a spreadsheet trying to lay out the various CAN signals and what they mean.

Byte 4 in the message from the pump is still a bit of a mistery
